# JMS

JMS is a CMS based on Angular that is fully configurable through JSON schema-s. JMS is very
opinionated especially when it comes to things like templating engines and email services, even though this should be easily interchangeable. 

Currently it only supports [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) as its
back-end but other implementations are planed and instructions for writing your own integration can
be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Jaspero/jms/wiki/Custom-Integrations).

A live example can be found [here](https://jaspero-jms.web.app/).

For more information consult our [wiki](https://github.com/Jaspero/jms/wiki).

**Note:** JMS is in active development and shouldn't be used in a production environment. Progress
towards our production ready goal can be tracked [here](https://github.com/Jaspero/jms/projects/1).
